# Auton Survival Package
<img align="right" width=50% src=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chiragn/auton_survival.png>

Repository of reusable code utilities for Survival Analysis projects.

## `auton_survival.datasets`

Helper functions to load various trial data like `ACCORD`, `BARI2D` and `ALLHAT`.
 
```python
# Load the TOPCAT Dataset
from auton_survival import dataset
features, outcomes = datasets.load_topcat()
```

## `auton_survival.preprocessing`
This module provides a flexible API to perform imputation and data normalization for downstream machine learning models. The module has 3 distinct classes, `Scaler`, `Imputer` and `Preprocessor`. The `Preprocessor` class is a composite transform that does both Imputing ***and*** Scaling.

 ```python
# Preprocessing loaded Datasets

from auton_survival import datasets
features, outcomes = datasets.load_topcat()

from auton_survival.preprocessing import Preprocessing
features = Preprocessor().fit_transform(features, cat_feats=['GENDER', 'ETHNICITY', 'SMOKE'], num_feats=['height', 'weight'])

# The `cat_feats` and `num_feats` lists would contain all the categorical and numerical features in the dataset.
```

## `auton_survival.estimators`

This module provids a wrapper to model BioLINNC  datasets with standard survival (time-to-event) analysis methods. The use of the wrapper allows a simple standard interface for multiple different survival models, and also helps standardize experiments across various differents research areas. 

Currently supported Survival Models are: 

- Cox Proportional Hazards Model (`lifelines`): 
- Random Survival Forests (`pysurvival`): 
- Weibull Accelerated Failure Time (`lifelines`) : 
- Deep Survival Machines: **Not Implemented Yet**
- Deep Cox Mixtures: **Not Implemented Yet**


 ```python
# Preprocessing loaded Datasets

from auton_survival import datasets
features, outcomes = datasets.load_topcat()

from auton_survival.estimators import Preprocessing
features = Preprocessing().fit_transform(features)
```


## `auton_survival.experiments` 

Modules to perform standard survival analysis experiments. This module provides a top-level interface to run `auton_survival` Style experiments of survival analysis, involving cross-validation style experiments with multiple different survival analysis models at different horizons of event times. 

The module further eases evaluation by automatically computing the *censoring adjusted* estimates of the Metrics of interest, like **Time Dependent Concordance Index** and **Brier Score** with **IPCW** adjustement. 

 ```python
# auton_survival Style Cross Validation Experiment.

from auton_survival import datasets
features, outcomes = datasets.load_topcat()

from auton_survival.experiments import SurvivalCVRegressionExperiment

# instantiate a auton_survival Experiment by 
# specifying the features and outcomes to use.
experiment = SurvivalCVRegressionExperiment(features, outcomes)

# Fit the `experiment` object with a Cox Model
experiment.fit(model='cph')

# Evaluate the performance at time=1 year horizon.
scores = experiment.evaluate(time=1.)

print(scores)
```




## `auton_survival.reporting`

Helper functions to generate standard reports for popular Survival Analysis problems.
